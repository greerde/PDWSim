# PDWSim
UDP PDW Simulator - .NET Core Version 

Run via command line: dotnet run. (run 'dotnet restore' first time after clone)
This version generates UDP packets as fast as it can for a set duration.  This duration is modifiable in code.  

This version also sets the frequency of the PDW to a couple different values.  These frequency values are set after the class is serialized for performance reasons for this simulator only - not for good programming practices!
